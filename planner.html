<!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is now a task-oriented tool. The structure is based on a main grid of content cards for easy scanning. A new "Done" section is dynamically rendered at the bottom to hold completed tasks. Clicking a card opens a modal, which serves as a dedicated workspace for each idea. This modal allows users to review all details, copy individual content pieces, and mark the idea as "done." This design was chosen to simplify the main view while providing a focused environment for task completion. The "Reset" button provides a way to re-use the entire content library, making the application a perpetual planning tool. State management is handled with localStorage to ensure progress is saved across sessions. -->
<!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: 100 video ideas grouped by service. -> Goal: Organize, Inform, and manage workflow. -> Presentation Method: A main grid of clickable cards and a separate "Done" section. Clicking a card opens an interactive modal. -> Interaction: Click to open modal, a checkbox to mark as "done," buttons to copy specific text, and a global "Reset" button. Report Info: Weekly posting schedule. -> Goal: Organize & Inform. -> Presentation Method: A visual 7-day schedule using a styled HTML flexbox layout. -> Justification: The new structure facilitates active workflow management beyond simple exploration. The modal provides a clean, distraction-free space for interacting with each content idea individually. All interactions are powered by vanilla JavaScript and the state is persisted using localStorage. -->
